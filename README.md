# Stiffness-analysis-of-a-6-DoF-serial-manipulator-with-a-counterbalance-mechanism

Designing a counterbalance mechanism and compensating the gravity is an important and a challenging task in serial manipulators. In this project we will present a modified model for a 3-DoF gravity compensation mechanism applied on a 6-DoF serial manipulator. Then we will model the stiffness matrix for the proposed design using Virtual Joint Modelling (VJM) and Matrix Structural Analysis (MSA). Then we will compare between the two models ant try to validate the results in the best possible way.
