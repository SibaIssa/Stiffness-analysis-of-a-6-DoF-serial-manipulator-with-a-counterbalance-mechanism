# Stiffness-analysis-of-a-6-DoF-serial-manipulator-with-a-counterbalance-mechanism

When we are working with serial manipulators, as we increase the number of Degree of Freedom
(DoF) and the more we add more joints and links the more we increase the mass of the robot. Having
a heavy robot is a critical problem; especially from the point of view of the actuators. In more details,
when we are increasing the the mass we are also increasing the gravitational torque so we need more
power in the actuators in order to compensate the gravitational torque in addition to the needed torque
for the task. That is why designing a counterbalance mechanism that compensate the gravitational
torque in all the joints is an important problem. In this prokect we are proposing a new design for a
3-DoF counterbalance mechanism for a 6-DoF manipulator.
